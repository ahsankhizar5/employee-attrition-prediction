# Employee Attrition Prediction

Predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. This machine learning project applies logistic regression and random forest models to classify employees likely to leave the organization, with performance evaluation and interpretability through SHAP values.

📄 Includes a comprehensive **Report.pdf** and **ProjectVideo.mp4** explaining the solution pipeline and results.
